# anomalo_notification_channel (Data Source)

References a notification channel. A Notification Channel is a destination for alerts from failed checks. Ex. a Slack channel or email address.

data "anomalo_notification_channel" "alert_channel" {
  channel_type = "slack"
  name = "#very-important-anomalo-alerts"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `channel_type` (String) The type of notification channel. One of "slack" "msteams" "pagerduty" "email" "email_all"
- `name` (String) The name of the notification channel. For example, "@squareJake". Because of a limitation in the Anomalo API, this may not work if the name is a substring of multiple channels (within the same `channel_type`). Ex if you have channels `#anomalo-alerts` and `anomalo-alerts-important`, it's not possible to use this channel to reference `#anomalo-alerts`. Instead, grab the ID directly from the Anomalo UI or API and store it in a variable.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) A unique ID. Generated by Anomalo.
