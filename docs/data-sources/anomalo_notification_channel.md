## Schema

### Required

- `channel_type` (String) The type of notification channel. One of "slack" "msteams" "pagerduty" "email" "email_all"
- `name` (String) The name of the notification channel. For example, "@squareJake". Because of a limitation in the Anomalo API, this may not work if the name is a substring of multiple channels (within the same `channel_type`)
