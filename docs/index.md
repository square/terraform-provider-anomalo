# Anomalo Terraform Provider (TFAnomalo)

TFAnomalo is a terraform provider that gives you the ability to manage [Anomalo](https://www.anomalo.com/)
resources in bulk with Terraform.

This plugin has benefits over other ways to manage your Anomalo setup. Namely:

- Version controlled, declarative configuration
- Bulk actions (ex with `for_each`)
- Line-by-line diffs
- Collaboration, via cloud based state and resource locks to prevent overwriting a teammate's work
- Variables
  - ex. update the notification time for all checks with a single variable change
- Use the same (or similar) check across tables & environments
- Integrate with your existing workflow

The biggest contributions of TFAnomalo are the Check and Table resources. These
map correspond to their counterparts in the Anomalo API docs. Those docs
should answer most questions you have about TFAnomalo objects and attributes. We
did make changes where necessary to design a configuration schema specifically for
Terraform. TFAnomalo documentation highlights any differences between the two
