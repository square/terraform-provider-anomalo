# anomalo_check (Resource)

An Anomalo check. Closely maps to the check object in the Anomalo API. Updating system checks (checks with negative IDs) is not supported by the Anomalo API and thus is not supported by this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anomalo_check" "VariationsGeneratedRecently" {
    check_type      = "TimeColumnNearNow"
    table_id        = anomalo_table.VariationsTable.id
    params          = {
        "pass_on_no_data_error"   = "false"
        "priority_level"          = "normal"
        "time_based"              = "false"
        "time_column_target"      = "_ingested_at"
        "time_when_lag_intervals" = "0"
        "window_begin_delta"      = "-26"
        "window_end_delta"        = "0"
        "window_unit_now"         = "hours"
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `check_type` (String) The type of check. Valid values are available in the Anomalo API documentation for `create_check`.
- `params` (Map of String) A map of parameters for the provided check type. Valid values are available in the Anomalo API documentation for `create_check`. Acceptable values differ by check type.

### Optional

- `check_static_id` (Number) The check ID, persists through updates. Implementation Detail: The Anomalo API implements check updates as a deletion of the old check + creation of a new one. When using this provider, you can ignore that detail by using `static_check_id`. This makes the resource behave like a typical HTTP resource.
- `ref` (String) A table-scoped, unique, human-readable identifier for the check that persists across updates. This provider relies on check_static_id rather than ref changes to checks, so it's possible to update the ref. If you used a version of this plugin before the attribute was introduced, you may have specified check in the Params. The top level Ref (this attribute) will take precedence if both are provided. Params-based refs may be unsupported in the future.
- `table_id` (Number) The ID of the table that this check belongs to. This can be specified by referencing the resource object, ex `anomalo_table.<resource_name>.table_id`. It should not be changed after creation.



## Import

### Importing

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# General syntax
terraform import anomalo_check.check_name table_id,check_static_id,check_ref

# In practice, only one of check_id or check_ref should be provided.
terraform import anomalo_check.check_name table_id,check_static_id
terraform import anomalo_check.check_name table_id,,check_ref # Note the double comma
```
