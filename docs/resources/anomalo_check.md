# anomalo_check (Resource)

An Anomalo check. Closely maps to the check object in the Anomalo API. Note that updating system checks (checks with negative IDs) is not supported by the Anomalo API and thus is not supported by this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anomalo_check" "VariationsGeneratedRecently" {
    check_type      = "TimeColumnNearNow"
    table_id        = anomalo_table.VariationsTable.id
    params          = {
        "pass_on_no_data_error"   = "false"
        "priority_level"          = "normal"
        "time_based"              = "false"
        "time_column_target"      = "_ingested_at"
        "time_when_lag_intervals" = "0"
        "window_begin_delta"      = "-26"
        "window_end_delta"        = "0"
        "window_unit_now"         = "hours"
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `check_type` (String) The type of check. Valid values are available in the Anomalo API documentation for CreateChecks.
- `params` (Map of String) A map of parameters for the provided check type. Valid values are available in the Anomalo API documentation for CreateChecks. Acceptable values differ by check type.

### Optional

- `check_static_id` (Number) A check ID that persists through updates. The Anomalo API implements check updates as deletion + creation. It does not support direct updates. This provider abstracts that detail and supports referencing checks strictly by their static_check_id. This makes the resource behave like a typical HTTP resource.
- `table_id` (Number) The ID of the table that this check belongs to. This can be specified by referencingthe resource object, ex `anomalo_table.<resource_name>.table_id`. It should not be changed aftercreation.



## Import

### Importing

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import anomalo_check.check_name table_id,check_id
```
